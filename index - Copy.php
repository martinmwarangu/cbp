		<h1>MANAGING DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE</h1>
		<h4><i></i><h4>
		<p>The National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) has for a long time continued to effectively play an important role in national food security 
		through procurement, management and distribution and sale of strategic Food reserves (SFR) stocks. The Board also procures and distributes subsidized 
		fertilizer on behalf of the government, a move which has greatly increased yields in the country.

		Post-harvest losses contribute significantly to food insecurity in the country. Grain farmers face a number 
		of challenges after harvesting their crop including lack of storage for their produce. To address this, the Board offers storage, drying and cleaning services 
		for grain at very affordable rates. Besides post-harvest services, NCPB leases out excess storage facilities, office space and residential houses. In addition,
		 it provides clearing and forwarding services for import and exported goods.

		The Board continually strives to offer good quality and affordable products and services to our customers and clients. Our high quality Nafaka Food products, 
		Mkulima Bora fertilizer and Huduma poa services are clear testaments to our commitment to provision of quality products and services. We regard our customers 
		as partners and every single feedback from them is highly valued and taken as an opportunity for improvement.

		We live our core values of teamwork, professionalism and high integrity. We are open and transparent and willing to share information. We encourage 
		collaborations and partnerships with our stakeholders for mutual benefit.</p>
